# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
DriverPass was a client that was looking for a web application that would allow students to make reservations and take practice test online. They also needed a system that would show progress and give the ability to be access documents offline and upload documents when connection is restored.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I believed I did a good job on the business design document. I was able to identify fuctional and nonfunctional requirements and also detail what type of security should be used.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would want to do further work on my diagrams. I was only able to capture a limited amount of functions within them, and i belive that more is needed to show the basic functionality of the system.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I used use cases to implement system design based around the needs of the user. I then created sequence diagrams and class diagrams based off the use cases. It is important to consider user needs when designing a system because they need a system that solves the problems that they have and need to have a system that functions how they want it to function as long as it is within technical limits.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I approach software design from a user's needs perspective. I read requirements and thanks to this class now can use documenting and design techniques to aid in my design of a system. Things such as creating use cases and diagrams to give me a better understanding of what I am designing or working on. Sequence diagrams give me the ability to see how a system flows when being used. Use cases help me See who and how an actor works with a system. I will alos be able to use one of the many other documents and diagrams that I have learned in this class.
